                <li>Ingredients:

8 ounces (about 2 cups) of your favorite pasta (e.g., fettuccine, linguine, or spaghetti)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

4 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup heavy cream

1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
                <!-- Add the rest of the ingredients here -->
            </ul>

                <!-- Add the rest of the instructions here --> 
Instructions:

Cook the Pasta: Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.

Sauté the Garlic: In a large skillet or pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, or until it becomes fragrant and slightly golden. Be careful not to let it burn.

Create the Creamy Sauce: Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the cream to thicken slightly. Stir in half of the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to stir until it's fully melted and the sauce thickens further. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning according to your preference.

Combine the Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce. Gently toss everything together to ensure the pasta is well coated with the luscious sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the pasta through.

Serve and Garnish: Once the pasta is hot and thoroughly coated with the sauce, transfer it to serving plates. Sprinkle the remaining grated Parmesan cheese on top and garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired, for a burst of color and flavor.

Enjoy: Serve your creamy garlic Parmesan pasta immediately while it's still hot. Pair it with a crisp salad, some crusty bread, or your favorite wine for a complete and delightful meal.

This creamy garlic Parmesan pasta is a crowd-pleaser that offers a perfect blend of creamy, cheesy, and garlicky goodness. It's a dish that's both comforting and sophisticated, making it a fantastic addition to your culinary repertoire. Bon appétit!
